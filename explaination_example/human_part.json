    "text": "Study: Mask mandates made no difference to COVID-19 transmission rates in hospitalsA study\u00a0has found that mask mandates made \"no discernible difference\" to COVID-29 transmission rates in hospitals.\nData also showed that infection rates didn't increase when mask mandates were not in place\u00a0in National Health Service (NHS) facilities amid a surge of omicron cases.\nDespite the data proving that face masks were ineffective, health experts argue\u00a0that this\u00a0does not mean face masks are \"worthless.\"\nThey also asked for \"rational and proportionate\" masking policies in hospitals for future coronavirus flare-ups due to the alleged \"modest\" benefits.\nDuring the height of the pandemic, governments across the globe, like the U.K. and the U.S., forced citizens to wear face masks\u00a0in indoor public spaces.\nBut many questioned the mask mandates because rigorous trials have already shown that they are ineffective.\u00a0As of writing, some\u00a0hospitals still require patients to wear face masks before entering, even though it is no longer legally required.\nFor the study, scientists from St. George's Hospital in South West London reviewed routinely collected infection control data over a 40-week period between December 4, 2021 and September 10, 2022. (Related: Lancet study DEBUNKS CDC argument for mask mandates in schools.)\nThe period marked the time between the first week omicron became the dominant COVID-19 variant and the week universal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 screening tests were discontinued.\nFrom Dec. 4, 2021, to June\u00a0 1, 2022, which was the first phase of the study, all hospital staff and visitors were required to wear masks in both clinical and non-clinical areas.\nBy phase two, the mandate was lifted and\u00a0decisions about mask policy were left up to individual hospitals.\nAccording to reports, high-risk wards, such as those treating cancer patients and intensive care units (ICUs), retained mask mandates.\nResearchers reported that lifting mask mandates in phase two did not produce a \"statistically significant change\" in the hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection rate. Additionally, they did not \"observe a delayed effect\" in the COVID-19 infection rate once the policy was lifted even though transmission of the virus was spiking within the community.\nThose in high-risk wards \u2013 considered the control group for the study \u2013 continued wearing masks. Data from the study showed that there was \"no immediate or delayed change in infection rate.\"\nFace masks have become a prominent symbol of COVID-19 culture wars\nIn the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks were considered an effective\u00a0virus-prevention measure. But in countries like the U.K. and the U.S., masks have become a prominent symbol of the COVID-19 culture wars.\nAdding to the anxiety of the public were officials often giving mixed messages about their effectiveness during the early days of the pandemic. People also remained skeptical about face masks because studies failed to conclusively show that wearing them could prevent coronavirus infections.\nIn February, the Cochrane Institute conducted\u00a0one of the most comprehensive meta-analyses of face coverings to date. Data showed that masks made \"little to no difference\" to coronavirus infection or death rates.\nThe scientists added that\u00a0the new U.K. study had potential limitations like other\u00a0observational studies, such as\u00a0not being able to determine staff infection rates and not assessing adherence to mask mandates.\nDr. Ben Patterson, the study's lead author, said the study didn't find any evidence that \"mandatory masking of staff impacts the rate of hospital SARS-CoV-2 infection with the omicron variant.\"\nDr. Aodhan Breathnach, another researcher who took part in the study, added that several other\u00a0hospitals have retained masking at \"significant financial and environmental cost and despite the substantial barrier to communication.\"\nBreathnach concluded that the results of their study can be used to \"help inform a rational and proportionate mask policy in health services.\"\nVisit\u00a0MedicalTyranny.com\u00a0for more articles about oppressive mask mandates.\nWatch the video below for more about COVID-19 mask mandate lies.\nThis video is from the\u00a0Think About It channel on Brighteon.com.\nMore related stories:\nYale professor scoffs at the idea that mask mandates are based on science.\nStudy: Face masks contributed to high COVID-19 death rates.\nGraphene-laced face masks raise health concerns.\nSources include:\nDailyMail.co.uk\nEurekAlert.org\nBrighteon.com",

    "text": "RNA vaccines don\u2019t strictly contain mRNA, they contain modRNA, which genetically manipulates (GMO) healthy human cellsIt is a misnomer, we are disturbed to report, for Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \"vaccines\" to be called mRNA, short for messenger RNA. It turns out that these deadly injections actually contain what is known as modified RNA, or modRNA, which Dr. Klaus Steger, PhD, says genetically manipulates healthy cells.\nSince mRNA is fragile and easily destroyed by the human immune system within minutes, Big Pharma is utilizing modRNA instead. And just as many warned as the case, modRNA genetically alters the human genome, rendering it a gene-editing technology that ultimately turns the human body into a hybridized trans-human GMO.\n\"To protect against destruction by the immune system, modified RNA (modRNA) is packaged in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which, due to their small size and synthetic optimization, can easily overcome biological barriers and even reach vital cells in the heart and brain,\" Steger writes for The Epoch Times.\n\"According to the concept of RNA-based injections, the antigen (here, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2) is synthesized by our cells and presented at the cell surfaces, where it serves as a target for the generation of neutralizing antibodies.\"\nThere are several problems with this process, though, one of them being the creation of antibody-dependent enhancement, or ADE, as a side effect. ADE allows endocytosis of virus-antibody complexes into the host's immune cells, which include macrophages, causing a weakening of the immune system.\n\"Put simply, non-neutralizing antibodies represent devils in disguise, making a person's body more susceptible to illness related to follow-up and booster injections,\" Steger explains.\n(Related: Check out our earlier report highlighting research from MIT showing that RNA vaccines are absorbed through the stomach and intestines.)\nRNA vaccines create redundant proteins, which interfere with proper cell metabolism\nAnother problem with modRNA is the fact that it transforms healthy cells, or friendly cells, into foe cells due to the attachment of the viral spike protein to their surface. The body mistranslates the healthy cell itself as being part of the viral spike protein and destroys it, causing progressive immune degradation, i.e., AIDS.\nSince the RNA-based shots for covid only deliver the genetic information for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein based on the Wuhan sequence, any perceived protection will be inferior due to a lack of cross-immunity. Any other strains, variants, or subvariants of covid, in other words, will not be recognized and the person, despite being \"fully vaccinated\" will still get sick.\nThe unvaccinated, meanwhile, have natural immunity to covid following exposure. And that natural immunity does perform cross-immunity to any and all forms of coronavirus that it encounters. Natural immunity, in other words, is real immunity and preferred immunity.\nAnother problem with RNA injections is that they produce redundant proteins, which negatively interfere with healthy metabolism. For metabolism to function properly, only essential proteins can be present inside a distinct cell at any given time, but RNA injections cause cells to be flooded with all sorts of interfering proteins that damage the process.\n\"Proteins, or mRNAs in healthy cells, can be compared to orchestra musicians: Harmony depends on various players pausing, not on every musician playing without stopping,\" Steger explains. \"Likewise, the absence of a specific protein / mRNA plays an essential role in metabolism.\"\n\"As modRNAs are developed for longevity and maximal efficiency and (via lipid nanoparticles acting as natural exosomes) have access to all cells, they contradict the nature of mRNAs, which are cell-specific and short-lived. In our orchestra analogy, it would be like giving one musician a bass drum and instructing him to bang it from start to end, completely ignoring the piece of music being played.\"\nUnlike mRNA, which degrades within minutes, modRNA persists for a very long time. This makes it a Trojan Horse that Steger warns \"may be worse than the disease.\"\nThe latest news about RNA vaccines and the globalist quest to transform all humans into trans-humans can be found at Transhumanism.news.\nSources for this article include:\nTheEpochTimes.com\nNaturalNews.com",

    "text": "Top 7 SERIOUS HEART PROBLEMS caused by the vascular-clogging Covid jabsThere are not many things more devastating to a parent than to watch their child's health spin out of control, or worse yet, the child passes away before they do. As of late, even the healthiest kids and teens on the planet are experiencing serious heart problems after getting the mRNA Covid spike-protein-producing \"vaccines.\" In case you are unaware, mRNA instructs human cells to produce millions of microscopic prions that resemble an influenza virus and invade every organ of the human body. Once there, the human immune system instructs the fight or flight system to respond accordingly, attacking the foreign pathogens across all systems and throughout the vascular system. This in turn creates massive stress on the heart, as the arteries are\u00a0clogged and clotted, limiting blood, oxygen, and nutrient flow. Healthy kids get struck hard, just take a look at all the athletes dropping to their knees, clutching their chests in agony.\nThe Covid clot shots can cause the human heart to suffer from muscle thickening, irregular beating, relentless pressure, and a long-term weakening\nSome people who got the clot shots experience irregular heartbeats afterwards and can't even fathom that it's caused by a \"vaccine,\" because all they hear and read about is the fake mantra that all vaccines are \"safe and effective.\" The Fauci falsehoods flood the televisions and newspapers. The CDC spews the disinformation across the nation daily. Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat that can feel like the heart is beating too fast, or too slow, or out of rhythm. Often, this is caused by blockages (sticky spike proteins) in blood vessels that cause a buildup of pressure, making the heart work harder, its muscle thicken, and eventually, a total weakening. Risk of heart attack and stroke rise quickly.\nAngina is chest pain from insufficient blood flow to the heart, as spike proteins clot and clog the arteries, blood vessels, and capillaries. There is no set time limit to how long mRNA \"technology\" causes the manipulated human cells to create these toxic prions, and the effects can be felt long after the toxic jabs have been administered. Fauci calls this \"Long Covid,\" but it's really just \"Long Vaccine Damage.\"\nMyocarditis is the swelling or inflammation of the actual heart muscle, and pericarditis is the swelling or inflammation of the sac-like tissue surrounding the heart. Both can be caused by mRNA jabs, as we see happening to athletes, pilots, and military members, even though they are some of the healthiest folks on the planet. That is why the RISK of Covid vaccine damage is FAR GREATER than any benefit, especially since kids and teens are at next-to-zero risk of complications from catching Covid, or any other flu for that matter. Think about that long and hard. This is worth careful consideration, especially with the upcoming plandemics that the Democrats and Bill Gates keep warning the world about. They must have something \"up their sleeves,\" besides some rubbing alcohol on a piece of cotton.\nTop 7 serious heart complications caused directly or indirectly by the vascular-clogging Covid jabs\n#1.

According to the midwives, placentas of vaccinated mothers are shrunken and have a silver-gray color. These signs mean that the placentas are not big enough to sustain a normal baby.\nWolf shared her interview with California nurse-midwife Ellen Jasmer, who has seen these silver-gray placentas since 2022. \"Some of these are shrunken. She showed me an image of a placenta that was like two inches in circumference, which is narrower, shorter and smaller than a normal placenta. Normal, healthy placenta is deep purple, or maroon and kind of thick. They're a home for a baby for nine months,\" Wolf said.\nJasmer also told Wolf about what she dubbed as \"COVID bumps\" or calcifications all over the placenta. According to the DailyClout CEO, these are visible to the naked eye.\nBen Armstrong of the New American magazine, who played Wolf's video about the abnormal placentas on his show, expressed shock over\u00a0the revelations.\n\"I thought she would say 40 percent, but no, none. One hundred percent of the people she's dealt with haven't seen a normal placenta.\"\nCOVID-19 shot a tool for depopulation\nArmstrong pointed out that Wolf's expose about the abnormal placentas only proves that the COVID-19 vaccine is a bioweapon aimed at depopulating the world. If the globalists cannot kill unsuspecting victims through the shots themselves, the injections will still sterilize people.\n\"We've all been saying this: One of the ways to depopulate would be to damage people's reproductive systems,\" he said. Armstrong recounted reports of the COVID-19 vaccine dramatically reducing men's sperm counts and seriously impacting women's reproductive systems.\n\"Yes, women do get pregnant. But these jabs are making it very difficult for them to go through their full-term pregnancy because their placentas are no longer normal after the shots.\"\nArmstrong also played an interview of Children's Health Defense founder and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who denounced Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates for rolling out the tetanus \"vaccines\" in Kenya.\u00a0(Related:\u00a0Bill Gates says vaccines can help reduce world population.)\nAccording to Kennedy, Gates and the World Health Organization \"administered a million vaccines to [Kenyans] that are designed to sterilize them without their knowledge and against their will.\" He told podcast host and former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly: \"Tetanus toxoid is essentially a chemical castration drug, and he gave at least a million women in Kenya. They had similar programs in Nicaragua, Mexico and the Philippines.\"\nMoreover, Armstrong pointed out that Kenyan doctors and priests\u00a0have noticed that the WHO and Gates administered the vaccines to Kenyan women six times a year instead of once every 10 years.\n\"On top of that, the tetanus program was only for women of childbearing age,\" the program host added. \"They made that obvious.

    "text": "People are losing their teeth and dentists say the cause could be covid \u201cvaccines\u201dEver since Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \"vaccines\" were unleashed through Operation Warp Speed, there has been a sharp uptick in the number of patients suffering from mysterious and severe symptoms associated with their teeth and bones.\nDr. Amy Hartsfield, an Alabama-based orofacial pain and dental sleep medicine specialist, says she has seen a massive increase in patients as of late who say their otherwise healthy teeth and jaw bones are hurting and even deteriorating for no apparent reason.\n\"I've seen patients with no previous history of health issues [who] have perfectly healthy teeth and now have pain syndromes associated with these healthy teeth,\" Hartsfield told the independent media.\nMany of Hartsfield's patients are suffering with head and facial neurovascular and myofascial pain that includes headaches, toothaches unrelated to the actual tooth or teeth, osteonecrosis of the jaw, sleeping problems, tinnitus, and oral and facial autoimmune conditions. Such conditions are linked to the propensity of Fauci Flu shots to cause \"micro\" blood clots throughout the body, Hartsfield explained.\n(Related: Covid vaccines are also linked to baldness.)\nCovid jabs are causing a lot of destruction to people's bodies, eventually leading to early death\nOne such person who started suffering severe bone loss after getting injected with Moderna's mRNA injection is 79-year-old Cheryl Alverson, who had to have all of her lower teeth extracted due to a massive recurring infection caused by extensive, post-injection bone loss.\nAlverson went to see Hartsfield, who ordered multiple blood tests, including several specifically associated with blood clotting. They showed that Alverson's body had become overloaded with microclots from the shots.\nHartsfield discovered that these microclots directly interfere with bone healing following extractions, not to mention the fact that they typically only occur in patients who are taking osteoporosis medication or who underwent radiation therapy, neither of which applied in Alverson's case.\nThe only thing Alverson did prior to developing these symptoms was take the Moderna mRNA series of injections for covid, as well as a follow-up booster shot. And almost immediately afterwards, her bone and teeth problems began.\nDr. Doug Denson, another Alabama-based oral surgeon, says he is seeing much the same thing with his patients, many of whom he is now referring to Hartsfield for treatment. Denson says he is not 100 percent sure covid jabs are the cause behind his patients' troubles, though there does seem to be a connection.\n\"In my opinion, correlation does not always equal causation ... again, there have been some odd symptoms since the pandemic started,\" he said. \"It's just impossible to tell the exact mechanism or cause.\"\nHartsfield has had to start screening her patients for their vaccine status due to the onslaught of new patients she is seeing who are suffering from teeth and bone problems post-injection.\n\"I have to screen these people to see if they've been vaccinated, when and how many times, and then I see if I can treat them,\" she said, adding that most practitioners do not screen for covid shots.\n\"When you ask the whole population to have a mandatory vaccine that has more side effects than any other vaccines in history showing in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, you will definitely see injuries.\"\nIn the comments, someone emphasized the fact that so-called SARS-CoV-2 has still never been isolated or proven to exist. The disease is the \"vaccine,\" this person argued, adding that lockdowns, mask mandates, job losses, and social isolation only made matters worse.\n\"Another monumental scam, from the fake PCR test to wearing disgusting face diapers that lower your oxygen uptake and increase carbon dioxide inhalation from your own breath, which increases bacteria growth in the mouth.\"\nCovid jabs are a death sentence.

    "text": "Even Mild Cases Of COVID-19 Can Leave A Mark On The Brain, Such As Reductions In Gray MatterResearchers have been steadily gathering important insights into the effects of COVID-19 on the body and brain. Two years into the pandemic, these findings are raising concerns about the long-term impacts the coronavirus might have on biological processes such as aging.\n\nAs a cognitive neuroscientist, I have focused in my past research on understanding how normal brain changes related to aging affect people\u2019s ability to think and move \u2013 particularly in middle age and beyond.\n\nBut as evidence came in showing that COVID-19 could affect the body and brain for months following infection, my research team shifted some of its focus to better understanding how the illness might influence the natural process of aging. This was motivated in large part by compelling new work from the United Kingdom investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the human brain.\n\nPeering In At The Brain\u2019s Response To COVID-19\nIn a large study published in the journal Nature on March 7, 2022, a team of researchers in the UK investigated brain changes in people ages 51 to 81 who had experienced COVID-19. This work provides important new insights about the impact of COVID-19 on the human brain.\n\nIn the study, researchers relied on a database called the UK Biobank, which contains brain imaging data from over 45,000 people in the U.K. going back to 2014. This means that there was baseline data and brain imaging of all of those people from before the pandemic.\n\nThe research team compared people who had experienced COVID-19 with participants who had not, carefully matching the groups based on age, sex, baseline test date and study location, as well as common risk factors for disease, such as health variables and socioeconomic status.\n\nThe team found marked differences in gray matter \u2013 or the neurons that process information in the brain \u2013 between those who had been infected with COVID-19 and those who had not. Specifically, the thickness of the gray matter tissue in brain regions known as the frontal and temporal lobes was reduced in the COVID-19 group, differing from the typical patterns seen in the people who hadn\u2019t had a COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn the general population, it is normal to see some change in gray matter volume or thickness over time as people age. But the changes were more extensive than normal in those who had been infected with COVID-19.\n\nInterestingly, when the researchers separated the individuals who had severe enough illness to require hospitalization, the results were the same as for those who had experienced milder COVID-19. That is, people who had been infected with COVID-19 showed a loss of brain volume even when the disease was not severe enough to require hospitalization.\n\nFinally, researchers also investigated changes in performance on cognitive tasks and found that those who had contracted COVID-19 were slower in processing information than those who had not. This processing ability was correlated with volume in a region of the brain known as the cerebellum, indicating a link between brain tissue volume and cognitive performance in those with COVID-19.\n\nThis study is particularly valuable and insightful because of its large sample sizes both before and after illness in the same people, as well as its careful matching with people who had not had COVID-19.\n\nWhat Do These Changes In Brain Volume Mean?\nEarly on in the pandemic, one of the most common reports from those infected with COVID-19 was the loss of sense of taste and smell.\n\nwoman smelling a peeled orange\nSome people with COVID-19 have experienced either the loss of, or a reduction in, their sense of smell.\nGetty Images\n \n\nStrikingly, the brain regions that the U.K. researchers found to be affected by COVID-19 are all linked to the olfactory bulb, a structure near the front of the brain that passes signals about smells from the nose to other brain regions. The olfactory bulb has connections to regions of the temporal lobe. Researchers often talk about the temporal lobe in the context of aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, because it is where the hippocampus is located. The hippocampus is likely to play a key role in aging, given its involvement in memory and cognitive processes.\n\nThe sense of smell is also important to Alzheimer\u2019s research, as some data has suggested that those at risk for the disease have a reduced sense of smell. While it is too early to draw any conclusions about the long-term impacts of COVID-related effects on the sense of smell, investigating possible connections between COVID-19-related brain changes and memory is of great interest \u2013 particularly given the regions implicated and their importance in memory and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe study also highlights a potentially important role for the cerebellum, an area of the brain that is involved in cognitive and motor processes; importantly, it too is affected in aging. There is also an emerging line of work implicating the cerebellum in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nLooking Ahead\nThese new findings bring about important yet unanswered questions: What do these brain changes following COVID-19 mean for the process and pace of aging? Also, does the brain recover from viral infection over time, and to what extent?\n\nThese are active and open areas of research we are beginning to tackle in my laboratory in conjunction with our ongoing work investigating brain aging.\n\nOur lab\u2019s work demonstrates that as people age, the brain thinks and processes information differently. In addition, we\u2019ve observed changes over time in how people\u2019s bodies move and how people learn new motor skills. Several decades of work have demonstrated that older adults have a harder time processing and manipulating information \u2013 such as updating a mental grocery list \u2013 but they typically maintain their knowledge of facts and vocabulary. With respect to motor skills, we know that older adults still learn, but they do so more slowly then young adults.\n\nWhen it comes to brain structure, we typically see a decrease in the size of the brain in adults over age 65. This decrease is not just localized to one area. Differences can be seen across many regions of the brain. There is also typically an increase in cerebrospinal fluid that fills space due to the loss of brain tissue. In addition, white matter, the insulation on axons \u2013 long cables that carry electrical impulses between nerve cells \u2013 is also less intact in older adults.\n\nLife expectancy has increased in the past decades. The goal is for all to live long and healthy lives, but even in the best-case scenario where one ages without disease or disability, older adulthood brings on changes in how we think and move.\n\nLearning how all of these puzzle pieces fit together will help us unravel the mysteries of aging so that we can help improve quality of life and function for aging individuals. And now, in the context of COVID-19, it will help us understand the degree to which the brain may recover after illness as well.",

One is to prepare for the next pandemic. The other reason is to track ongoing viral epidemics \u2013 not only coronaviruses, but also other deadly and economically impactful viruses like HIV or influenza.\u201d   \n\nDNA is best known for its genetic properties, but it also can be folded into custom nanoscale structures that can perform functions or specifically bind to other structures much like proteins do. The DNA nets the Illinois group developed were designed to bind to the coronavirus spike protein \u2013 the structure that sticks out from the surface of the virus and binds to receptors on human cells to infect them. Once bound, the nets give off a fluorescent signal that can be read by an inexpensive handheld device in about 10 minutes.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated that their DNA nets effectively targeted the spike protein and were able to detect the virus at very low levels, equivalent to the sensitivity of gold-standard PCR tests that detect the virus\u2019s genetic material but can take a day or more to return results from a clinical lab.\n\nThe technique holds several advantages, Wang said. It does not need any special preparation or equipment, and can be performed at room temperature, so all a user would do is mix the sample with the solution and read it. The researchers estimated in their study that the method would cost $1.26 per test.  \n\n\u201cAnother advantage of this measure is that we can detect the entire virus, which is still infectious, and distinguish it from fragments that may not be infectious anymore,\u201d Wang said. This not only gives patients and physicians better understanding of whether they are infectious, but it could greatly improve community-level modeling and tracking of active outbreaks, such as through wastewater.\n\nIn addition, the DNA nets inhibited the virus\u2019s spread in live cell cultures, with the antiviral activity increasing with the size of the DNA net scaffold. This points to DNA structures\u2019 potential as therapeutic agents, Wang said.\n\n\u201cI had this idea at the very beginning of the pandemic to build a platform for testing, but also for inhibition at the same time,\u201d Wang said. \u201cLots of other groups working on inhibitors are trying to wrap up the entire virus, or the parts of the virus that provide access to antibodies. This is not good, because you want the body to form antibodies. With the hollow DNA net structures, antibodies can still access the virus.\u201d\n\nThe DNA net platform can be adapted to other viruses, Wang said, and even multiplexed so that a single test could detect multiple viruses.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to develop a unified technology that can be used as a plug-and-play platform. We want to take advantage of DNA sensors\u2019 high binding affinity, low limit of detection, low cost and rapid preparation,\u201d Wang said.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health supported this work through the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics program. The researchers will continue to work through the RADx program to explore and accelerate clinical applications for the DNA net platform.\n\nWang also is affiliated with the Holonyak Micro and Nanotechnology Lab and the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois.",

    "text": "Patients with Chronic Illnesses from WTC Exposures More Likely to Suffer \u201cLong-Term\u201d COVIDA study of 1,280 patients treated and monitored at the Stony Brook World Trade Center Health and Wellness Program who also contracted COVID-19 reveals that the responders who have suffered from chronic conditions from WTC exposures and the experience of the 9/11 tragedy appear to have more infection severity and long-term sequelae than responders who do not have chronic diseases resulting from WTC exposures. The findings are published this month in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.\n\nGroundzero2\nMany WTC responders suffer from chronic conditions caused by exposures at Ground Zero. Now some of these patients are struggling with long-term COVID issues, too.\nLed by Benjamin Luft, MD, director of the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program and lead author, the study compared patients with WTC-related chronic disease and those without such conditions. All of the patients tested positive for COVID-19. The study participants had a wide range of symptoms or had no symptoms from the infection. They were categorized as having moderate (n=536), mild (511), or severe symptoms (104), or asymptomatic (129).\n\n\u201cOur findings point toward the need to monitor these chronically ill patients who contracted the infection even more closely,\u201d said Dr. Luft. \u201cThey all suffer from various chronic conditions brought on by exposures at the World Trade Center site. This study alerts us to even more problems they may face in the future.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that a number of existing chronic conditions appeared to predispose the patients to COVID-19-related severity, and/or were associated with long-term COVID sequelae. For example, they reported that among those with severe infections, 60 percent had previously diagnosed upper-respiratory disease, 49 percent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 35 percent have obstructive airway disease, and 20 percent have concomitant psychiatric disease.\n\nOf note is that patients determined to have significant COVID-19 sequelae were measured by self-reported severity scales.\n\nAfter an analysis of the data from each of the participant groups, the researchers determined that COVID-19 severity was independently associated with age (older with more severity), Black race, obstructive airway disease, and with worse self-reported depressive symptoms.\n\nDr. Luft and colleagues point out that why some individuals have more severe COVID-19 is unclear in any population and is not fully understood. The same can be said for this population, as scientists continue to explore the full reasons why some people develop severe infection and others do not.\n\nThe authors further write that in their patient cohort \u201cCOVID-19 disease severity was the strongest and the only factor significantly and consistently associated with the main post-acute COVID-19 sequelae outcome, as well as symptom-specific categories of post-acute COVID-19 sequelae. Taken together, the results contribute new evidence that both pre-existing respiratory and mental health conditions constitute risk factors for more severe COVID-19 symptoms, which in turn can put patients at a higher risk for long-term health sequela.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong COVID was very common, especially in those individuals with chronic conditions with more severe infection symptoms. In fact, 57 percent of WTC responders with symptoms severe enough to cause hospitalization had persistent COVID symptoms,\u201d said co-author Sean Clouston, associate professor, Department of Family, Population and Preventive Medicine at the Renaissance School of Medicine, and Program in Public Health.\n\n\u201cWith re-infections on the rise, it is incredibly important that we continue to monitor the impact of COVID on these responders and that we consider the possibility that these COVID infections have already left a lasting imprint on this group and much of the public\u2019s health,\u201d he emphasizes.\n\nDr. Luft says that this patient population will be monitored closely as society moves further out from the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 essentially to determine whether post-COVID-related health issues continue or increase more with this group compared to the program\u2019s other WTC responder patients.\n\n\u201cWe are doing further studies to see if the reason for persistent symptoms connected with the infection is due to continued inflammation in the brain and lungs,\u201d added Dr. Luft, citing one example of their follow-up clinical research of this particular responder population.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health.",

In a study, the RNA-encoded viral nucleic acid analytic reporter correctly determined the alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and omicron genetic mutations in nasopharyngeal clinical samples. This ability could enable healthcare providers to make personalized treatment decisions for improved patient care.\n\nRecently published online in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, a paper on the research describes the design and validation of the Revealr SARS-CoV-2 genotyping system.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for individualized diagnostic tools that can recognize the presence of the virus as well as the particular strain. Identifying and triaging patients infected with variants that increase viral transmissibility and reduce vaccine protection is critical to controlling spread of the disease,\u201d said corresponding author John Chaput, UCI professor of pharmaceutical sciences. \u201cRevealr goes beyond simple COVID detection methods, such as the commonly used antigen kit, to identify the precise SARS-CoV-2 strain infecting a patient.\u201d\n\nThe team analyzed 34 clinical samples collected in early, mid- and late 2021 at the UCI Medical Center from patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. The RNA was isolated from the nasopharyngeal swabs, and the correct SARS-CoV-2 variant was identified in every case.\n\n\u201cAlthough Revealr was developed as a COVID detection assay, the next step is to expand to other respiratory tract infections that share symptoms with COVID-19, like influenza,\u201d Chaput said. \u201cThe ability to distinguish single-point mutation in a DNA or RNA genetic sequence makes it ideally suited for any genotyping, including cancer. Beyond human health, Revealr could find use in forensic or agricultural applications that currently rely on DNA sequencing.\u201d\n\nThe study team included Chaput lab member Kefan Yang, a graduate student in chemical and biomolecular engineering; Chaput lab member Daniel Schuder, a graduate student in molecular biology and biochemistry; and Arlene Ngor, who manages the Chaput lab.\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on Revealr genotyping.\n\nThe collection of clinical samples was supported by the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center Experimental Tissue Shared Resource under National Cancer Institute award number P30CA062203.\n\nAbout UCI\u2019s Brilliant Future campaign: Publicly launched on Oct. 4, 2019, the Brilliant Future campaign aims to raise awareness and support for UCI.

    "extractive_sum": "Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have developed a COVID-19 test that can detect and identify specific SARS-CoV-2 variants with 100% accuracy. The test, called Revealr, correctly identified genetic mutations in clinical samples, including the alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and omicron variants. This ability could help healthcare providers make personalized treatment decisions for better patient care. The researchers plan to expand the use of Revealr to other respiratory tract infections and even genotyping in areas like cancer research. The study team has filed a patent application for Revealr genotyping.",
