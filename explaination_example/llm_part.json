The study, which analyzed 42 guidelines including 18 specific to COVID-19, compared them with guidelines for MERS and SARS.\n\nContrary to expectations, the clinical guidelines were found to be detailed and covered a wide range of topics. Recommendations were consistent and provided clear guidance, particularly regarding the use of antiviral drugs. The overall quality of the guidelines was deemed excellent, with high scores in stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence. The study also found strong links between evidence and recommendations.\n\nFurthermore, the guidelines demonstrated a strong commitment to inclusivity, with comprehensive provisions made for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, and older people. This inclusive approach ensures that all populations receive appropriate care and support during the pandemic.\n\nThe study concludes that the guidelines available early in the COVID-19 pandemic were of exceptional quality and inclusivity.
