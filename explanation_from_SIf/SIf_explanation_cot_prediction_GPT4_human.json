The researchers examined records from the Leprosy Clinic at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London. They found that of the 52 people who went to the clinic in 2021, at least 49 were vaccinated. The study definition of a leprosy adverse event associated with a COVID-19 vaccine included developing leprosy or a leprosy reaction within 12 weeks of receiving a dose and the person having no previous history of leprosy or a leprosy reaction. Two people met the case definition. One developed borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy one week after a second dose. The other experienced a reaction 56 days after a dose. Both doses were Pfizer\u2019s BNT162b2 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines can provoke a response from white blood cells, or T cells. The cells are believed to protect against COVID-19. T-cells can theoretically trigger Mycobacterium leprae, a bacteria that causes leprosy, leading to leprosy or a leprosy reaction, the researchers said. Other vaccines have been shown to trigger leprosy or leprosy reactions, including tuberculosis vaccines, and some people who receive repeated COVID-19 vaccinations have been shown to have weakened immune systems. The person diagnosed with leprosy is an 80-year-old man who has lived in the United Kingdom for 49 years. He suffered from symptoms including thickened nerves. The leprosy diagnosis was confirmed via skin biopsy. The man may be the first to acquire leprosy in the UK since 1954. The man improved over time and actually received a third dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine. The reaction was recorded in a 27-year-old man who had taken multidrug therapy, a drug for leprosy, in the past. He developed red plaques and thickened nerves before arriving in the UK from an unidentified country. A biopsy supported the diagnosis. Of the 52 people who went to the Leprosy Clinic for diagnosis and/or treatment in 2021, all but two reported their vaccination status. Of those 50, 49 were vaccinated.

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database contains historical data on adverse reactions reported against every vaccine administered in the United States. Analysis of the VAERS data shows a dramatic spike in cancer cases among those vaccinated with the Covid shots. Comparing the number of cancer cases reported as adverse reactions to the Covid injections with other available vaccines reveals a significant difference. The number of adverse events related to cancer reported per 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered is 0.43, while for flu vaccines, it is just 0.0003. This means that Covid vaccination is 1433.33 times more likely to cause cancer than flu vaccination. Scientific evidence also suggests that the Covid mRNA injections can cause cancer of the ovaries, pancreas, and breast. The spike protein produced by the mRNA shots can damage the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes, potentially leading to cancer. Additionally, patent documentation from Moderna, one of the manufacturers of Covid vaccines, shows that the shots contain DNA fragments linked to birth defects and cancer. The failure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address this issue raises concerns, especially as several FDA officials secured jobs with Moderna after approving the shots. Dr. Robert Malone, one of the inventors of mRNA vaccine technology, highlighted these concerns during a recent hearing on Capitol Hill.
